# Call Center Analytics Dashboard 📊

This project showcases an end-to-end **call center analytics dashboard** built to analyze
call volume, service levels, answer speed, and abandonment trends across multiple dimensions.

The goal is to move beyond reporting and deliver **actionable operational insights** that support
capacity planning, staffing optimization, and SLA performance.

---

## 🔍 Business Problem
Call centers face fluctuating demand throughout the day, often resulting in:
- SLA breaches during peak hours
- Increased Average Speed of Answer (ASA)
- Higher call abandonment rates

This dashboard helps identify **when and why service levels drop** and highlights
repeatable demand patterns for proactive workforce planning.

---

## 📊 Key Insights
- Call demand peaks consistently between **11 AM and 5 PM**
- Higher call volumes directly correlate with **increased ASA and abandoned calls**
- Demand spikes are **pattern-driven**, not random
- Early morning and late evening hours show **low and stable demand**, indicating scope for lean staffing
- Weekly and hourly trends support **predictable shift alignment and break planning**

---

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- **Power BI** – Data modeling, DAX measures, interactive visuals
- **Excel / CSV** – Source data preparation
- **Data Visualization** – Heatmaps, trend analysis, KPI cards
